# Idea behind Frequency Pattern
1. Usually use an object
2. Use said object to construct a profile/ way of breaking down contents of array or string
3. Able quickly to compare objects

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
This can often avoid the need for nested loop operations with arrays/strings.

To run programs, might need to change launch.json cause I can't figure it out
OR
node {programName.js}
